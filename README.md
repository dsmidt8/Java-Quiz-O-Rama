## About the Project
In this project I used java script to create a quiz that:
* prompts the user to start the quiz
* Displays four unique questions in a random order
* Has user input Initals to commit their high score to local storage
* Has a link at the top to take the user to the high scores
## Usage

To run the program open the link in your browser

## Getting Started

To start the quiz click 'Start Quiz' button on initial page

## Process

* I started by creating a list of requirements for the website
* I then started by creating sections on HTML for each portion of the quiz
* I then added the class 'hide' so that I could remove the sections that did not need to be displayed.
* I then researched where there were knowledge gaps in java script knowlege
